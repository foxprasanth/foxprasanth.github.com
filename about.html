<p>I am a blogger. As a quick learner from my childhood,I always search for new things to learn and practise.Always happy to meet new people and making new friends. </p>

<p>A socially active person. I am kind of a person who strongly believe that knowledge must be given to everyone and the ultimate work after learning something is to spread the knowledge gained to others.</p>
