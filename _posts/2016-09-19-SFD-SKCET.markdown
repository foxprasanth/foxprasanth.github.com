<h3>SFD - Software Freedom day, Sept 17,2016</h3>
<p>On this day, every year, open source enthusiasts around the world conduct numerous events promoting FOSS. Being a contributor for Mozilla and a student of SKCET, I too thought I should do something similiar in my college.</p>
<h3>Mozilla on campus</h3>
<p>With the brand new program "Mozilla on campus" coming up very soon, I thought it was the perfect time to give the students in my college an introduction to Mozilla and opensource contributions</p>
<p>Thus I contacted Mozilla contributors in my region (TamilNadu) and requested them to conduct session on that day</p>
<p>Finally our awesome Mozilla reps, Mr.Karthickeyan and Mr.Vishwaprasath extended their support and agreed to come to the event</p>
<h3>On the event </h3>
<p> Mr.Karthickeyan and Mr.Vishwaprasath arrived in our college by 2.00pm. We had lunch and the event started by 2.30pm.</p>
<p>With more than 75+ students inside the hall, the event started off with the session by Vishwaprasath. He motivated the students by saying how his contributions to Mozilla improved his life.</p>

<h3>Web-compat</h3>
<p>Then Vishwaprasath showed a demo about how the Webcompat.com actually works and the idea behind it. The students after seeing the demo started searching for bugs in websites.</p>

<p>The students were divided into groups and each group was assigned a range of values.Then they went to alexa.com where they got a list of sites to verify using the range of assigned values.</p>
<p>Many students enthusiastically participated in this session and there were around 10 bugs filed in webcompat.com during the it</p>
<p>Finally Karthic gave introduction to MozWebVR and also gave demo to the students using his VR headsets.</p>
