<h3>Testing Day</h3>
<p> It is the day in which many volunteers from all over the world come to the Mozilla QA site to get the latest version of Firefox browser to test.</p>
<p>Each test day will have specific components to test and the test cases to be executed will be provided. The participants have to execute the test cases and enter the results in the etherpad.For knowing more about testing days, visit -<a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/">Mozilla's QA website</a></p>
<h3>My First Testing day</h3>
<p>I came to know about the testing days while pondering over various areas of contribution.As I never had any experience in testing before, I was little afraid to participate thinking it may be a very difficult task to accomplish.</p>
<p>To my suprise, the procedure looked simple and test cases were easy to execute. Within an hour I was able to complete the test cases.</p>
<p>I think the QA contribution suits me well. Hoping to learn and contribute more in this area in future :-) </p>
