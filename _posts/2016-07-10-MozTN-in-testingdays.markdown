<p>Helen Keller once said, 'Alone we do so little and together we can do much'. Her saying is suitable for every act.</p>
<p>By participating in the last Testing day, I came to know that participating in testdays is easy and no prior experience is needed to do testing.</p>
<p>After that, I saw another testing day to be held. So I thought that, it would be great if many of my friends join and contribute together.</p>
<p>So on the day before testing day, I sent a message in the Mozilla TamilNadu telegram group, asking interested people to join me on the test day. Soon after my message was delivered many showed their interest in participating.</p>
