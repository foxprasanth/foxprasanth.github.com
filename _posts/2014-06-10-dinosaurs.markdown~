<p>My First speech as an FSA was at THE DOT, which was held at Gandhigram University, Chinnalapatti, Madurai. It was a one-day event.  Seshan , my good friend and an FSA, planned and organized the event. There were 24 participants from other colleges in Madurai. The event went on as THREE parts.</p>
