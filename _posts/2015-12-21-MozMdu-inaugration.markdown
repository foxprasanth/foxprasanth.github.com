<p>I was excited to know that there will be a club to be started in Madurai. Gowtham Venkat, an FSA from Amritha University, contacted me via FSA facebook group. He informed me regarding the event.</p>

<p>The Event took place in Mozspace Madurai.There were around 20 participants from various colleges in Madurai. I have learned many things during the event regarding localization and other ways in which we can contribute to open source.</p>

<p>At first we had a session on Introduction to FOOS,Mozilla , webmaker tools,FSA program. Then we had a good discussion on digital India and Net neutrality. It was then followed by FSA signing up program which was to get other participants.</p>

<p>Then a good description of Localization contribution was given by Ameer Bro. Before this event I was unaware that Firefox is avalaible in Tamil. Adding to my astonishment, I found that Every mozilla product has a Tamil version. He then cleared the air that this translation work can be done with ease. He explained about the two localization tools â€“ Pootle and Verbatim. I gained knowledge about regarding the ways we could contribute to Mozilla by using this simple tools.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful event indeed!!!! eager to attend more events in future..</p>
