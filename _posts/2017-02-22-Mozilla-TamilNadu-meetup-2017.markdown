<h3>Mozilla TamilNadu Meetup 2017</h3>
<p>It was a 2 day meetup that took place in KGISL college, coimbatore on 21st and 22nd January 2017, bringing in contributors from various parts of TamilNadu and that aimed </p>
<b>elevate new contributors to do consistent contributions to Mozilla.</b>
<h3>For me</h3>
<p>After Mozilla India Meetup, this is the second biggest Mozilla meetup I ever attended and it was also a golden opportunity to meetup all amazing contirbutors in the community a single place.</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p> Day 1 was all about building the community. We had amazing introduction session and launched brand new Mozilla TamilNadu Logo</p>
<p>Later we had video sessions from amazing Mozilla staffs explaining various programs that Mozilla is working on.</p>
