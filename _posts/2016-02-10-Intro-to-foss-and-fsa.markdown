<p>I signed up for FSA program in the month of September and for the past few months I attended many online and offline events conducted by the Mozilla TamilNadu Community. Then I started thinking that I must share my experience and the knowledge gained with my college mates and also connect my college mates to this wonderful community.</p>
<p>This got me getting things arranged for the event along with the support of my faculties. As a result I conducted a session on Introduction to <b>FOSS and FSA program</b> in my college on Feb 10 2016 which lasted for a hour</p>
<p>There were <b>15 participants</b>. 5 boys and 10 girls</p>

<p>The event started with introduction to FOSS and its importance, after which participants were explained about Mozilla and its open web goals</p>
<p>Then there was a quick discussion on FSA program and its various levels. All participants showed interest in the program and they were provided the links for signing up for FSA.</p>
<p>After the sign up process, the various contribution areas were explained and at the end of the event , the future plans were discussed</p>
