<h3><b>Before the Event</b></h3>
<p>On 31st January myself and Seshan attended a Google event at Web2all company where we fortunately got 45 minutes time which we wanted to put it into a good use ..
we actually started discussing about the privacy issues that we are facing right now ..
Which somehow we got the attention of others .Then we thought sharing about privacy to all, with this precious time was an excellent idea .</p>
<h1><b>Topics discussed</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Privacy and Security</li>
  <li>Lightbeam</li>
  <li>phishing</li>
  <li>HTTP vs HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>During Event</b></h3>
<p>Fortunately, I had brought my laptop containing the presentation which I used in <a href= " ">the Privacy Campaign in my college.</a>I gave a kickstart by interacting with audience and introducing them to term "online privacy" and also by showing a demo of Lightbeam.</p>
