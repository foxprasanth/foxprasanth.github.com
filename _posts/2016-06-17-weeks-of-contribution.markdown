<h5>WEEKS OF CONTRIBUTION</h5>

<p>It is a great initiative by <a href ="http://mozillatn.github.io/">Mozilla TamiNadu Communtity</a>, to help new contributors to learn more about the various contribution areas. This also encourages the existing contributors a chance to teach others.</p>

<h5>Great! But how it is done?</h5>

<p>This year, Week of contribution takes place in two stages. Stage 1 - The long time contributors( we call them Mentors) conduct an online session regarding the contribution methods to aspiring contributors. Stage 2- After attending the session, The contributors would conduct an offline event on the topic which they learnt from the Mentors to other new contributors. This two stage programme ensures that every contribution from all contributors is noticed and appreciated.</p>

<h5>My expectation</h5>

<p>Mozilla TamilNadu community has helped me a lot to grow myself in many ways. This particular program, will enrich my opensource knowledge for sure. I also see this program as a gateway to improve my presentation skills and as a training for me to motivate new contributors towards contributions.</p>

<h5>Why I joined this community??</h5>
<p>I joined this opensource community because of a single reason. Learn! Learn new things!!! I am glad that I've joined in it. Everyday is a new learning curve for me. Getting in touch with many people, is the best part of being a member of such communities. With each new person you come into contact, You get to know new stuffs. They lead to new ideas. These ideas makes your progress!!</p>

<h5>My Team</h5>
<p>Nothing is impossible with a good team in your hand. I am very happy to contribute also with these people by my side.</p>

<h5>Other Ways</h5>
<p>This is opensource!! So there must be many other ways for contributions. I would like to contribute by participating in Testing Days(Mozilla QA), translating SUMO articles and also spreading the Mozilla's mission to as many people as possible</p>
