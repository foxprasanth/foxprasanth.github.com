<p>After saying goodbye, I welcome 2017, with a plan ( sort of :P )</p>
<p>Have a look at this</p>
<ul>
<li>Make localised (Tamil) tutorial for QA contributions</li>
<li>File atleast 20 good bugs</li>
<li>Bring 30 new participants to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Testdays">TestDays</a></li>
<li>Need to promote participating in BugTriage days and Bug Verification Days</li>
<li>Write atleast 5 Marionette scripts ( Firefox UI Automation testing framework )</li>
<li>Guide atleast 5 contributors in their interactions with community and contributions</li>
<li>And help them to nuture as a 'quality' contributor to Mozilla</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is it!</p>
