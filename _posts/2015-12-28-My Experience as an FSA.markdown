<p>It all started in the month of September 2015. I attended an one-day workshop by Google Developers Group –Madurai. There, I came in contact with Google Student Ambassadors in Madurai. I requested  them to help me while applying for GSA program. When I returned to home, I  wondered whether all tech companies have student ambassadors program. So I made a google search to know more. While doing so, my eyes were caught by the FIREFOX STUDENT AMBASSADORs link. I was awestruck by the way MOZILLA loves open-source and open-web.I was also felt overjoyed when I saw the registration is very simple.</p>

<p>Then I started to dig more on FSA program . Within few minutes , I have learned that FSA program is one of the best ways to contribute to open-web and  the open-source community. The way each FSA is recognized  for his events attracted me.This encouraged me to sign up for the program and I was very curious to know more...</p>

<p>In the month of March, I had an opportunity to address around 25 participants in an event, There I realized the happiness in teaching others of what we know. I see this FSA program a gateway to gain and spread knowledge.</p>

<p>The people in Mozilla TamilNadu community are simply awesome!! I have learned a lot from them. With each passing day I was able to gain more things</p>

<p>It is super cool to be an FSA and I am very happy to be one!</p>
