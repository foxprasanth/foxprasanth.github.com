<p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>For the past two weeks various contributors from all over TamilNadu have been contriubting to Localisation as a part of the Weeks of contribution 2016. Here is my contribution report.</p>

<p>I have been contributing to localisation in past occasionally. The best way to start contributing to any opensource project is localisation. And I have conducted couple of events in which the localisation was a part.</p>

<p>Localisation can be done by many tools. Pontoon is a simple yet powerfull tool for localisation. I have used it to do my contribution.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/prasanthmani2010@gmail.com/">my pontoon profile</a>.I have been suggesting words in the following projects</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox Accounts</li>
<li>SuMo</li>
<ul>
<p>I am very happy to have Mr.Khaleel, a Mozilla rep, as my mentor for this localisation contribution.</p>
<p>As I have conducted enough events in the past with my contributors in the past and provided the simplicity of Pontoon, I did not conduct a seperate event regarding localisation again. So we went to action straight away!</p>
<p>My suggestion score is 105.</p>
<p>My contributor <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/contributors/aishwaryabalachandran66@gmail.com/">Ms.Aishwarya</a> made suggestions around 113.</p>
<p>Thus together we made <strong>218</strong> suggestions so far.</p>
<p>It was great to work in localisation , For those who are entering into opensource contribution,I strong recommend them to try in localisation in their mother tongue. It will give you a great boost to work more!</p> 
<p>Be happy by contributing!!!!</p>
<p>See what we do in our #MozTNWOC2016 in twitter</p>
