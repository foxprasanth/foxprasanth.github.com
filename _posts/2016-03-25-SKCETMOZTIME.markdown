<h3>SKCET MOZTIME</h3>
<p>It was on February 20th, I conducted the first FSA event in my college. After the event, I have connected the new FSAs in telegram.</p>
<p>During first few weeks the telegram group was very active. We discussed a lot and many of my friends clarified their doubts and they were very motivated and started to  contribution areas such as Localisation and filing bugs in Bugzilla. After few weeks, there was a change,the group started to become inactive. I thought that people were losing their interest in contributing. So I started to ponder over the solutions to make the new FSAs, stay motivated and active.</p>
<p>My prime motivation is that new FSAs should not be idle after signing up (As I was wasting 6months :-( after signing up as an FSA ) After many discussions and thinking , I realized that it will be better if we organize in-person meetups rather than online chatting. Thus started - SKCET Moztime -  A regular meetup of FSAs of SKCET</p>
<p>The main goal of these meetups is to learn , share and create things, that supports Open web and motivating people towards Open source  contribution.</p>
