<p> This one event was online too...But the difference is.. It was not in seperate site like the event, It took place in Our whatsapp group!</p>
<p>The group chat started with content of the event msg</p>
<p>Many great contributors from TamilNadu were online in during the chat..Each of them explained about a contribution area and I was able to get to know the basics in each of them.</p>
<p>Along with that,various levels in FSA program was listed and also some tips for conducting events in colleges were given.I had many doubts and they answered to all my questions spontaneously</p>
<p>Atlast there was a brief explanation about Foxfooding by Viswaprasath.At the end of the day.. It was an interesting and fun filled event</p>
