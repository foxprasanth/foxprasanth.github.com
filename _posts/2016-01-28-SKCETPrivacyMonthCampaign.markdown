<h1><b>Our TeamWork</b></h1>
<p>It was a great day for us. Myself and my friends - NagaManikandan and Kiran Kumar J , three of us conducted the Privacy Campaign in three classes at the same time covering around 200 students and 10 faculties. Many students were interactive and most faculties showed great interest in the topic</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">My first event in my college</span>
<p>I spoke in a class of 70 students. During the first few minutes, I explained the data explosion and what big corporate companies do with these data</p>

<p>This was continued by the information on Tracking. When I began to say more on the same, the students were found curious.</p>
