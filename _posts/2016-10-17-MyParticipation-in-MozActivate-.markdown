<h3>MozActivate</h3>
<p>It is one of the awesome initiatives by Mozilla to promote the contributions of new open-source technologies like webVR,Rust etc</p>

<p> Like every Mozillian in the planet, I too got excited on seeing the new activities in the site. And started going through the same. My mind was very eagerly thinking about conducting atleast once event as a part of the campaign</p> 

<p>When I expressed my willingness to Mr.Vishwaprasath, a Mozilla Rep, he suggested me to have a look at the Featured addons testing</p>
<p>On going through the event details in the website, I realised that this particular contribution is quite easier. So I decided to work on it.</p>
<p>Thus I called out Mozillians in India to participate in the <a href="https://mozillatn.github.io/blog/MozActivate-AMO-e10s-compatibility-sprint/">e10s compatibility testing sprint</a>. 
It was initially planned to be a one day sprint, many contributors were unable to participate on the day. So the sprint extended till the weekend.</p>
