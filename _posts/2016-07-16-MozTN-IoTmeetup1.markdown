<h3>About the Event</h3>
<p>The MozTN IoT meetup series is the series of meetups which aims to provide the necessary knowledge and tools to active participants of Mozilla TamilNadu community (Coimbatore region) regarding the Internet of Things and thereby helping them in making a complete IoT solution for common man's problem. It is conducted by Mr.Vigneshwer, a Mozilla Rep and an active participant in Mozilla TamilNadu Community.</p> 
<h3>My experience</h3>
<p>I and my friend Kiran kumar reached SNS college of Technology around 10:30AM where the first meetup was scheduled to take place. We were received by Mr.Paartibalaji, the club lead of SNSCT Firefox Club. We then joined the group of people who were gathered to attend the meetup. We introduced ourselves to one another.</p>
<p>Then Mr.Vigneshwer arrived. He started off with the importance of gaining knowledge in IoT as it a booming field of technology. Then he briefly described the meetup plans and the agenda of the event.</p>
<p>Event started about 11:30AM. The first part was introduction to Git and Github. The explanation was clear and all the basics commands like creating a repository,pushing,pulling,brancing and merging were covered. It went upto 1:30AM.</p>
