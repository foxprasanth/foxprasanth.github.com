<p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>The topic of this session was Git. There were 12 participants. The event lasted for around 30 minutes. At first the participants were introduced to the Git and brief explanation of their applications were told.</p>

<p>Then I started telling the various commands starting from initialization. Since this is an introductory event, the participants were given the basic commands only (i.e till branching). </p>
