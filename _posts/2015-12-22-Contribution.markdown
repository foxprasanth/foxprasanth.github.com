<p>Initially when I was informed about this contribution weekend event,the first question which hit my mind was "When & where the event will happen?". When my friend replied that it is an online event, I was puzzled... many questions..many clarifications.. Even after that I severly doubted the efficiency of conducting such an event. Then I stopped thinking the problems and started to wait for day</p>

<p>On the Event day,in the morning,Venkat, Dropped the links for the etherpad and chattzy in my inbox via which the event was happend to take place.</p>
<p>After opening the etherpad, I found out that the contribution to be discussed today is "Documentation"
Karthick, Regional Ambassador in Lead,TamilNadu, already had dropped the links for learning regarding the Documentation process and Mozilla Developer Network </p>
<p>In the Evening, I started reading the articles and the links in the Etherpad. Few people joined for chat and I had a good time, learning new things without getting distracted</p>
<p>The Event was great and it was easy to pick up as well, because of the time given was 24 hours</p>
