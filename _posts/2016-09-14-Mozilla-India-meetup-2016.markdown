<h3>Mozilla India Meetup 2016</h3>
<p>It was a pan-India meetup that took place in Pune on 27th and 28th August 2016 ,comprising people from many parts of the country with one common goal</p>
<b>To restructure Mozilla India community.</b>
<h3>For me</h3>
<p>It is the biggest Mozilla India event that I have attended ever before.Though I have talked with my regional contributors before via TG and voice calls, It was the first time I was going to meet them in person.Also I was very much excited to meet new big contributors from other parts of the country. With loads of anxiety and happiness I departed form Coimbatore along with Gautham Raj bro, Paartipabalaji and Ashly Rose and reached Pune on 26th afternoon.</p>
<p>We reached the Hotel Holiday Pune Inn after 1 hour travel from the Pune airport. After couple of hours , other contributors from my region (Tamil Nadu) arrived and I had the oppportunity of meeting Karthickeyan, Vishwaprasath bro , Amar bro and Survesh.</p>
<p>For the dinner, we were asked to come in our traditional wear, there was a whole lot of people , wearing traditional dress. And the entire room was looking awesome!</p>

<p>Then we had a couple of activities.There was also a debrief about the event as whole.</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>The first day of the meetup was started with the overview of the meetup.It was followed by George's session about Mozilla's goals. At the end of the session I had a very clear idea about the importance of Mozilla India's role as an active community for Mozilla. </p>
<p>Then the members were split into groups based on the colour of a sticker which they stick into our tags.I got into the session facilitated by George. I joined with Vibhanshu Chaudhary, Shina Dhingra , Kumaresan and Sumanth Damarla</p>
<p>We were asked to analyse the issues which concerns about Digital inclusion, every one in the group participated vey well , in the given time we were able to make a chart presentation.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">While discussing Digital Inclusion</span>
<p>I was able to grab the Internet issues which people/governement face these days.</p>
<p>Then the there was this "Personal leadership development session". It was very usefull for me , I understood many things regarding the leadership qualitites</p>
<p>Next there was another breakout session. This was based on the functional areas. I choose "Rust Programming". It was handled by Manish. The session gave me a clear picture of Rust languages necessity and pros over other languages. Manish explained the various components and structures of the Rust and its usage.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we had the important session of all - <span style = "text-decoration : bold">The new structure of Mozilla India community.</span> Every one received a booklet containing proposed restructure of Mozilla India community</p>
<p>Then the structure was explained by Deb, Kaustav and George.</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>The second day started off with Bradley explaining the Developer marketing and brand awareness.</p>
<p>Then we had a session on Team performance and Mobilizing </p>
<p>This session was full of fun. The activities which we made helped me understand how a leader must be and also how people should respect others ideas and proposals.</p>
<p>Then our breakout session started.I choose "Web compatability" track.</p>
<p>The web compatibility session was handled by Bradely.Everone knows Mozilla, which supports the notion that web must be open for all, also helps the web developers to develop websites.During this session , I came to know that it has taken a step more,through the web compatibility, Mozilla tries to help the developers in making websites cross-browser compatable.I was very much impressed by Mozilla's mission for this web.</p>

<p>And finally, The most awaited part of the meetup started. The new structure of Mozilla India was released and the modifications from the previous version was discussed on the day one. It was an amazingly new structure which I personally think, is flexible enough to maitain such a huge community.</p>
<p>It was a great experience for me and I have met many new friends</p>
<p>Thanks Mozilla India for giving me such a everlasting memory. I will surely be a part of growing the Mozilla India stronger in the days to come</p>
